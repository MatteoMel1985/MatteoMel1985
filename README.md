**Î‘Î³Î¬Ï€Î·**,  

And welcome to my page.  

My name is Matteo Meloni, and I currently work as a FinOps Specialist at Amazon, where I have developed a strong foundation in data analysis, financial operations, and process engineering. I am now actively pursuing a transition into a Data Engineering role, in which I bring a data-driven mindset and a deep understanding of operational scalability.  

To support this career shift, I have completed several industry-recognised certifications, including the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, with additional credentials listed on my profile. I am committed to staying at the forefront of the field through continuous learning and hands-on project work.  

Rigorous technical case studies are a core part of how I demonstrate my ability to design, implement, and explain data solutions. They include step-by-step guidance for others aiming to pass the same certifications, or to repeat the same procedure with a high-degree of precision. I want to contribute to data-driven organisations by combining technical proficiency with clear communication and practical insight.
